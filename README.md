# App Development as a Bharat Intern
Mobile Application Development Internship, Participating in the virtual internship as an app developer at Bharat Intern was an incredible journey that provided me with valuable insights into mobile app development and enhanced my skills in various areas.
# TASK 3: QUIZ (DEVELOPED USING FLUTTER)

Task 3 was undoubtedly the highlight of the internship for me. Developing a quiz app using Flutter was both challenging and rewarding. I had to create a dynamic and engaging quiz app that could present questions to users, track their answers, and calculate scores. It required me to manage state, handle user interactions, and design an appealing UI. Developing the quiz app honed my problem-solving skills and introduced me to the world of mobile app testing and debugging.
